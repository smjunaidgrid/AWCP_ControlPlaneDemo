"""An autonomous, governed LangGraph WORKER runtime (AWCP "agent on a runtime").

Not a chatbot: it pulls GOALS off a task queue and executes each one in multiple
steps using its tools, performing real governed WRITES:
  - read/compute tools: web_search, multiply, add, power, word_count, current_time
  - save_artifact  -> governed LOCAL write  (medium risk, gated)
  - external_post   -> governed EXTERNAL write (high risk, gated + needs approval)
The task queue, worker loop, governance, approval flow and UI live in awcp_kit;
this file only supplies the framework agent + the run_goal() hook.

Run as:  python agent_runtime.py   (launched with an ABSOLUTE path by run.sh so
the detector can read this file and see the `langgraph` import).
